 * The <code>ToolkitRegistry</code> interface offers basic services and methods to allow
 * any Toolkit Applet to register its configuration (supported events) during
 * the install phase and possibly to change it during all the applet life time.
 * Each Toolkit Applet will get a reference to its registry entry with the static
 * method <code>getEntry</code> from the <code>ToolkitRegistrySystem</code> class
 * The initial state of all the events is cleared. The registry entry object implementing
 * the <code>ToolkitRegistry</code> interface is a permanent JCRE entry point object<p>
 *
 * All updates performed on the <code>ToolkitRegistry</code> are atomic. The <code>ToolkitRegistry</code>
 * update operations are subject to atomic commit capacity limitations. If the commit
 * capacity is exceeded, no update is performed and a <code>TransactionException</code> exception is thrown.<p>
 *
 * Note: the constants related to the events are defined in the <code>ToolkitConstants
 * </code> interface.
